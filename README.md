## Firmware for Cane Cage Identification

## Description
This project contains the firmware developed for the **ESP32-C6** microcontroller, designed to identify multiple **cane cages** connected to a **cane truck**. It uses a **DS2432** to read the unique addresses of several **DS2431** devices, enabling traceability and efficient management of the cages.

## Objective
To enable automatic identification of cane cages using 1-Wire technology, improving logistics and control in sugarcane transportation operations.

## Usage
Once the firmware is uploaded, the ESP32-C6 will begin scanning the connected DS2431 devices and report their unique addresses, allowing each cane cage to be identified.
